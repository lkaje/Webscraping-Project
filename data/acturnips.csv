1. **NO WETSUITS.** I will terminate the session for good if I see ANYONE changing into them.
2. Follow the gated path to the Nooks and sit outside the shop on the public benches once you're done. Please be patient and wait for other sellers from your group to finish so I can boot you out and make the process faster. **DO NOT LEAVE ON YOUR OWN** unless I say you can leave on your own.
3. I am taking **four people per group**, and will probably do this for two or three hours. Maybe I'll take a break and go for another round, who knows, it depends.
4. **Single trips only, please do not ask if you can do more than 1.**
5. **If the Dodo code gets shared, I will terminate the session completely.**

Okay, so, u/MrKrabsTorsion made at least 2 posts saying he had a 594 price, and charging 5NMT entry fee, which is against the rules.
