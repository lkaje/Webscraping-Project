AnimalCrossing,"So I've been trying to complete this game for a while and I've been working on Smile Isle the past two weeks. I couldn't find any information on how the request system worked. Therefore I theorycrafted with my viewers for a couple of days and we found out how to get these quickly.

This is all theories and are tested with hundreds of hours of game play but seem to work. There are different tricks and a lot of smaller theories around this. But let's get down to the basics.

**You can get TWO requests per hour from talking to your villagers**  
As soon as you start one, write down the time you get the sound of it starting. When you are done with that request, go find the other one, write that time down to. After one hour has passed from the first time you can find another one. And so on.  
*The requests has an individual cooldown of one hour from when you pick them up.*

That's the basic rule. You can use this to look for a new one on the first cooldown over and over again or come back when both are up and do it again, do it with your playstyle! I went from talking to everyone all day to just finding them every hour and doing the requests within 10 minutes. Below I'll write some tips and tricks me and the viewers found. I went from 100 requests to 240 in 8 days.

**Tips and tricks, some might not be 100% but worked for me**  
\- One villager will have the request, talking to the same one will not give you it if they don't have it.  
\- Go through all villagers you can find systematically.  
\- Backing out to the title screen and going back will rotate who has it, useful if they are in a store or the museum.  
\- It seems like certain villagers have a higher chance to have them at certain points of time. Write down who you get it from and try them first when the time is up.  
\- Talk to villagers at least 5 times, I always expend all dialogue and have gotten requests as late as the fifth talk.  
\- Villagers running up to you or having thoughts bubbles and gives you requests are bonus requests, they do not affect the regular requests  
\- Save specific fish and bugs, having extra cicadas, bugs from flowers/stumps will greatly speed up doing the requests.  
\- Finding lost items and giving medicine are also bonus requests

All right! I hope this helps anyone as it would have helped me!

AnimalCrossing,"Because I am a wistful nerd, I was dreaming up a future game for the series and wonder what you think. 

Imagine an Animal Crossing game where your little village is at the center of a large island, and it eventually grows into a big town with something like 30 villagers. Big enough that you've built roads for transportation, workplaces and shops for villagers to work at, apartment buildings that house several villagers, amenities, and attractions for tourists. Picture your favorite villager riding a freaking bike around streets you built!

Your little city is part of a large island with game-generated villages, points of interest, and tourist spots. A big part of the game is about connecting your city to these other spots and then road tripping to places around you. You have villagers who live in the city you run, and then animals who live elsewhere, doing their own thing, moving in and out more often so you have more animals to meet.

Villagers would have greatly expanded features. The businesses you build are workplaces that can employ your villagers, giving players services, shops, and town amenities, plus giving villagers places to go so they aren't always wandering around aimlessly. 

Your villagers can pal around with you to go fishing or whatever, or could even jump in the back of your car to go on a trip together. Build up enough friendship to get unique furniture, clothes, or services in your town, encouraging you to befriend as many villagers as you can.

The multiplayer in the game works through airports - players fly into their friends' islands and can road trip around together. Everyone's landmass would be generated differently with lots of tools to customize it. Player built hotels allow you to visit or stay in a town even if the host is offline, by downloading it and giving you 24 hours to ""vacation"" there. If you made it so that not every type of fish or insect can be found on every island, or so you needed to visit specialty shops to access certain types of furniture or clothing, it would encourage players to travel around to other towns.

A game like this would need a lot of new animal designs (since you'd see more) and a ton of content, but I feel like it would build on the construction that was introduced in NH. It might be closer to a spinoff than an AC game, which is why I'd call it Animal Crossroads. It describes the traveling aspect and also splits it off from the main series somewhat.","""Animal Crossroads"" - a concept for a new Animal Crossing game with big towns on a larger map made for road tripping","Because I am a wistful nerd, I was dreaming up a future game for the series and wonder what you think.
