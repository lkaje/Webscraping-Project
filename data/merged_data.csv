61,AnimalCrossing,"So I've been trying to complete this game for a while and I've been working on Smile Isle the past two weeks. I couldn't find any information on how the request system worked. Therefore I theorycrafted with my viewers for a couple of days and we found out how to get these quickly.

This is all theories and are tested with hundreds of hours of game play but seem to work. There are different tricks and a lot of smaller theories around this. But let's get down to the basics.

**You can get TWO requests per hour from talking to your villagers**  
As soon as you start one, write down the time you get the sound of it starting. When you are done with that request, go find the other one, write that time down to. After one hour has passed from the first time you can find another one. And so on.  
*The requests has an individual cooldown of one hour from when you pick them up.*

That's the basic rule. You can use this to look for a new one on the first cooldown over and over again or come back when both are up and do it again, do it with your playstyle! I went from talking to everyone all day to just finding them every hour and doing the requests within 10 minutes. Below I'll write some tips and tricks me and the viewers found. I went from 100 requests to 240 in 8 days.

**Tips and tricks, some might not be 100% but worked for me**  
\- One villager will have the request, talking to the same one will not give you it if they don't have it.  
\- Go through all villagers you can find systematically.  
\- Backing out to the title screen and going back will rotate who has it, useful if they are in a store or the museum.  
\- It seems like certain villagers have a higher chance to have them at certain points of time. Write down who you get it from and try them first when the time is up.  
\- Talk to villagers at least 5 times, I always expend all dialogue and have gotten requests as late as the fifth talk.  
\- Villagers running up to you or having thoughts bubbles and gives you requests are bonus requests, they do not affect the regular requests  
\- Save specific fish and bugs, having extra cicadas, bugs from flowers/stumps will greatly speed up doing the requests.  
\- Finding lost items and giving medicine are also bonus requests

All right! I hope this helps anyone as it would have helped me! Remember that everyone plays this game differently and not judge others if they play it as you don't like.How to get 25+ villager requests per day for Smile Isle"

148,AnimalCrossing,"Hi guys! Ok this is not a serious matter, just trying to have some fun here. 

I like to gift clothes to my villagers matching their favorite style and color but also matching their personality. I'm doing great except for Bud! 

The guy is a jock lion, his default shirt is a pineapple aloha shirt, his house is yellow with a straw roof and I placed it just on the beach, so he's clearly a surfer. LOL

I need to find something that:

\- Matches Bud's preferences (active, simple / green, yellow)

\- Looks good with his pink sunglasses

\- Makes him look like a surfer

I tried with zigzag shirt (looks cool on him but not so much with his pink glasses) and tie-dye shirt (I don't like it very much).

If there are some fashion stylists out there, let me know what do you think about. If you find me the perfect gift for him the reward is free surfing session with Bud himself!I need a fashion stylist for Bud üòÇ"

317,AnimalCrossing,"Because I am a wistful nerd, I was dreaming up a future game for the series and wonder what you think. 

Imagine an Animal Crossing game where your little village is at the center of a large island, and it eventually grows into a big town with something like 30 villagers. Big enough that you've built roads for transportation, workplaces and shops for villagers to work at, apartment buildings that house several villagers, amenities, and attractions for tourists. Picture your favorite villager riding a freaking bike around streets you built!

Your little city is part of a large island with game-generated villages, points of interest, and tourist spots. A big part of the game is about connecting your city to these other spots and then road tripping to places around you. You have villagers who live in the city you run, and then animals who live elsewhere, doing their own thing, moving in and out more often so you have more animals to meet.

Villagers would have greatly expanded features. The businesses you build are workplaces that can employ your villagers, giving players services, shops, and town amenities, plus giving villagers places to go so they aren't always wandering around aimlessly. 

Your villagers can pal around with you to go fishing or whatever, or could even jump in the back of your car to go on a trip together. Build up enough friendship to get unique furniture, clothes, or services in your town, encouraging you to befriend as many villagers as you can.

The multiplayer in the game works through airports - players fly into their friends' islands and can road trip around together. Everyone's landmass would be generated differently with lots of tools to customize it. Player built hotels allow you to visit or stay in a town even if the host is offline, by downloading it and giving you 24 hours to ""vacation"" there. If you made it so that not every type of fish or insect can be found on every island, or so you needed to visit specialty shops to access certain types of furniture or clothing, it would encourage players to travel around to other towns.

A game like this would need a lot of new animal designs (since you'd see more) and a ton of content, but I feel like it would build on the construction that was introduced in NH. It might be closer to a spinoff than an AC game, which is why I'd call it Animal Crossroads. It describes the traveling aspect and also splits it off from the main series somewhat.""Animal Crossroads"" - a concept for a new Animal Crossing game with big towns on a larger map made for road tripping"
318,AnimalCrossing,"I instituted a ‚Äúno leaving until I get your framed photo‚Äù policy and I‚Äôm now up to 26! All through loving my villagers, no trading. I love having this lil piece of friendship from all the ones who‚Äôve come and gone."

I've fallen in love with the process and I'm having such a blast with Animal Crossing! I had loads of equipment from my time as an editor and started using it to stream with.

Honestly, even though these times are hard, it feels good to have some sort of schedule in my life again! This game has really picked me up and I love this community. I played a lot of New Leaf on the 3DS but New Horizons has come at a perfect time for me and I think that it's great to have a game that can really become a safe space.

Theres already a dock in game for kappn to park his boat. Maybe he could stand near the entrance of the dock and not on his boat in the dock, so that you could still catch rare fish there.

The game just feels so empty multiplayer wise without the minigames and such. Thoughts?How long do you think it will be before Kappn is added to the game?"

2. When you get the code **PLEASE REPLY** so I know you read the message and are on your way. I'll probably try groups of 3 or 4 if queue is long to lessen the start/stop nature of the game.
3. Go with your group up to the shop **(go left from entrance and up to cliff)** and sell your nips. Feel free to say hi to me and leave a tip **(DIYs or bells preferred)**. I'll be sitting by the entrance in a pineapple print dress and large sunhat. I also have two free DIY stands set up if you want to take something. Feel free to also leave a couple of your duplicate recipes next to them for other sellers to take.
4. When you are done, **LEAVE** **VIA THE AIRPORT.** One trip per person. If I see you a second time, I will end the session for everyone. I just want to get as many people through as possible. And **NO WETSUITS**. Wearing one and/or jumping off the airport dock will result in an ended session for everyone.[SW] Merry and Pippin buying for 6-3-7"

210,acturnips,"Hello sellers, welcome and I'm happy that you are taking interest in Jabberbott's sales. Before you enter the island, here are a few things you should keep in mind. 

&amp;#x200B;

1. **NO WETSUITS.** I will terminate the session for good if I see ANYONE changing into them.
2. Follow the gated path to the Nooks and sit outside the shop on the public benches once you're done. Please be patient and wait for other sellers from your group to finish so I can boot you out and make the process faster. **DO NOT LEAVE ON YOUR OWN** unless I say you can leave on your own.
3. I am taking **four people per group**, and will probably do this for two or three hours. Maybe I'll take a break and go for another round, who knows, it depends.
4. **Single trips only, please do not ask if you can do more than 1.**
5. **If the Dodo code gets shared, I will terminate the session completely.**

That's all the things you should keep in mind! :-) I will be waiting and sitting down on the garden bench as the lil girl with the pink dotted raincoat, being semi-idle and looking through the queue list.

Rules to come:

\~ no wetsuits (will close out if you show up with one)

\~ diys and clothes at airport are free to take. 

\~ free to buy anything at Nook's cranny as well

\~ If sign up gets long I will change the flair to finished even before we are done so that people don't keep signing up and we can try to get to everyone.

\~ No promises everyone will be gotten to. 

\~ You will be chat messaged to see if your ready to come before code is given. Ready means at your airport ready to leave. If your not ready say so and we can come back to you. 

\~ In game name and island name in flair must match what we will see when you fly in if it doesn't match exactly don't ask to come. 

\~ leave thru the airport so as to not cause issues for others thanks.

623,acturnips,"This is what I get for making a post about how great everyone is, I guess.

Okay, so, u/MrKrabsTorsion made at least 2 posts saying he had a 594 price, and charging 5NMT entry fee, which is against the rules.

The reason it is against the rules is because of what MrKrabsTorsion did, which is, he would grab the NMT and immediately end the session so that the person didn't get to sell, because probably there was no 594 price. 

Yes, he is a bad person.

HOWEVER. The vast majority the approximately 150 responders, in the 7 threads I can see that were removed by Automod, is a person who contributed to their own victimization by replying and agreeing to be extorted.

The rule exists to protect you. If you see posts demanding entry fees, particularly high entry fees, they are likely to be scams. Even if it's not a scam, it's against the rules. Don't reply.
